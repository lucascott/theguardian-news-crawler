### Getting started

If you already have crawled the data you can skip straight to the step 3.

1. Simply set your The Guardian API key (if you don't have it, get one [here](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/))

2. Set a new environment variable named `THEAPIGUARDIAN` with your api key as value

3. Run the `start.sh` script that you find in this directory
